# AirPIT
Created by the Spring 2020 MSFC Washington Health &amp; Air Quality project. This tool displays particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde,  methane, and ozone concentrations in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Users can select a region and dates of interest, and display pollutants for those.
